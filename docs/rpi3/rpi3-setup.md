Students buy:
| Item                                | Provided By | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rpi3 board (Model B or B+)          | Student     | [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)  |

Loaner instructions for students:
1. students specify which of the following items are needed. NB: for lab1--3, only item 1--5 are in use.
2. if you need item 1, specify: are you using WSL2 or VM
3. contact: Afsara Benazir (TA) hys4qm@
4. Hardware-kit pickup spreadsheet (mark AFTER the pickup) [link](https://myuva.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/XSEL-afsara-next/EdYnzYErdZ1AnqmaAjGY2_QBQWsVQ2lCzCud1rGTHytnIQ?e=k0St0w)
5. keep any package and cables that come with items (esp item 4 the display), and return the item in its original package.

| 3. A micro SD card reader that plugs in to personal computers                      | Lab1 & later  |   the loaner reader is USB-A, not USB-C. Update: On Mac, built-in SD reader cannot be passed through to VMfusion. Use a USB reader instead. ~~If your laptop lacks USB-A ports (e.g. a recent Macbook Pro), chances are that it has a built-in SD slot already; you just need a cheap microSD-SD adapter (no SD card reader needed) which TAs can provide~~                                  |
| 4. A display w/ HDMI + an HDMI cable                     | Lab1 & later  | The loaner display comes with the needed HDMI-microHDMI cable & USB-C power supply   |
| 5. A power supply for rpi3 (Micro USB, 5v3A, with inline switch) | Lab1 & later   | In a pinch, rpi3 can be powered via a microUSB cable connected to any USB-A port (e.g. from your PC, or any cheap USB charger). That should suffice for lab1/2 which do not draw high power. For later labs, better use 5v3A charger to provide enough power                                                            |

## 2. Prepare SD card 

Assume that you have finished setting up VM [here](../vm/vmware.md). 

Connect the SD card reader to VM. Then in the VM: 
```
cd uva-os-main/make-sd/ 
sudo ./make-sd.sh /dev/sdX
```

Details here: [How to prepare SD cards for experiments](../../make-sd/README-make-sd.md)

## 3. Connect the UART cable

```
Rpi3 <-- a USB-serial cable ---> PC (running a terminal emulator) 
```

After you get a serial cable, you need to make the connection. 

### 3.1 The legacy dongle (for VM users; not for WSL2 or native Win10 due to driver issues) 

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/035/695/small360/learn_raspberry_pi_piconsole_bb.png?1473736644)

### 3.2 The newer (SH-V09C5) dongle (for WSL2 or VM users)

![alt text](image.png)

### 3.3 An example setup of Macbook Pro, which uses USBA-USBC adapter for the UART dongle. Note that HDMI is yet to be connected. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b2dd91b-a9b3-46d6-b516-0a42f4f89558)

## 4. VM/Linux users: Configure the serial emulator

Assume that you have finished setting up VM [here](../vm/vmware.md)

**Notes on pass through USB devices** 

- on some laptops (e.g. Macbook Pro), the built-in SD card readers cannot be passed through to VM. If that happens, use the USB card reader instead. 
- if you have a complex USB topology (e.g. the target USB device connected to a hub, which then connects to a dock, which connects to your computer), the 
VM may not be able to recognize the USB device. 
In that case, directly connect the USB device to a USB port on your computer 
- if your laptop lacks USB-A ports, use a USBA-USBC adapter (often <$2) which the TA should be able to give you one.

### 4.1 Pass through the SD card reader
Often, when you plug in an SD card reader, there's a pop-up asking if you want to connect it to the VM. 
Say yes. 
If not, you can manually connect it.

Example screenshot on Windows (Mac has a similar interface): 

![alt text](<sd card reader.jpg>)

Once passed through, the VM (Ubuntu) should automatically recognize the SD card partitions (check the taskbar on the left), 
and automatically mount the partitions as 
`/media/student/bootfs` and `/media/student/UVA-OS/`

### 4.2 Pass through the USB-UART dongle

In the same way: 

![alt text](<vmplayer usb icon.jpg>)

And confirm it: 

![alt text](<vm usb choice.jpg>)

On Mac, it's similar:

![Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 7 28 07â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55dba7f0-8ad8-4ea2-ad47-5718c1d6f250)

After that, do `sudo dmesg` from the VM terminal. Look for things like: 

![alt text](<usb serial dmsg.jpg>)

Here, the messages show that the USB-serial adapter is recognized as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

### 4.3 Configure minicom via its config file (already done for VM users)

create the configure file, if it does not exist
```
sudo gedit /etc/minicom/minirc.dfl
```

And enter the following contents
```
pu port             /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate        115200
pu bits            8
pu parity          N
pu stopbits        1
pu rtscts          No
pu addcarreturn  Yes
```

Save the file. 

### 4.4 Launch minicom

From the VM command line: 
```
sudo minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -C /tmp/minicom.log
```

Warning: your OS may give different names to the USB-serial dongle, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB1. Find it out by looking at `dmesg` output above. 

That's it. Continue to rest of the rpi3 setup [../rpi3/rpi3-setup.md](../rpi3/rpi3-setup.md).

```
sudo minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -C /tmp/minicom.log
```

## 5. WSL2 users: Configure the serial emulator

PuTTY recommended. A sample configuration below. 

![image-20210210120642726](image-20210210120642726.png)

Change the terminal settings like this:

![alt text](image-2.png)

Note: your PC may give different names to the USB-UART dongle, e.g. COM4. Find it out by looking at Windows Device Manager. 

## 6. Power up & test

Use a microUSB power supply rated at 5V3A or higher. 
In a pinch, rpi3 can be powered via a microUSB cable connected to any USB-A port (e.g. from your PC, or any cheap USB charger, often rated 5V1A). That should suffice for lab1/2 which do not draw high power. 
For later labs, better use 5v3A charger to provide enough power. 

If everything works OK, the provided "test" kernel (`make-sd/bootfs/kernel8-rpi3.img`, md5sum 074d1c0bae0a3572bc302d8f3d017a97) will boot and show on the UART: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6e1f4a1-5f8b-4061-add5-51ef65eb627f)

To test the display, try `make-sd/bootfs/kernel8-rpi3-display.img` (to use it, rename this file to kernel8-rpi3.img on SD card and reboot rpi3).
it will cycle through four colors on display:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/194a12e3-30f1-481e-9378-114059aae0f9

## 7. Build and install your kernel 
```
cd uva-os-world1
export PLAT=rpi3
```

| Action              | Command             |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| To clean up         | `./cleanall.sh`     |
| To build everything | `./makeall.sh`      |

If everything builds OK, `kernel/Makefile` should copy the kernel image (kernel8-rpi3.img) to the SD card, in the "bootfs" partition. See `kernel/Makefile` for details.

## 8. GAMEHAT setup

Follow the Waveshare website instructions to assemble it. LEAVE THE back cover off. Plug in the speaker for sound. Insert SD card and power up.

![alt text](image-4.png)

However the UART pins are blocked. To access it for debugging: 

Connect the 40pin header extender to the Rpi3. The connect the serial cable to the extender.

![alt text](image-5.png)

Put Rpi3 back on

![alt text](image-6.png)

Connect the display to the Rpi3 via a HDMI cable (the hard HDMI connector that comes with the gamehat is too short -- not used).
