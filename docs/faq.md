# CS4414/6456 - Have the right attitude

Updated: Jan 2025

**Q1: is this course difficult?** 

OS is supposed to be difficult otherwise I'm not doing my job. You need to: 

* Have a right attitude. Try hard before seeking for help. 
* Master tools, including debugger, git, Google, and ChatGPT
* Understand code details. 
* Manage setback, emotion, and frustration. 

**Q2:** **I have no idea what is going on with assignment X. Help!**

Have you read the project description and tinkered with the code? Instead of having a vague complaint, please state something concrete such as : "I understand A. I think B means ... and did some experiments. But I do not know how to get C work. Please help." Then bring that to Piazza/OH. 

**Q3: my code does not work. help!** 

As the course goes on, some students will start directly throwing problems to instructors, expecting for answers. Example: "my program does not work and here is the error message. What should I do?" This is unacceptable. It's one thing that you attempted and sought for help; it's another thing "my code breaks, what to do". 

**Q4: why there are too many low-level details? I am frustrated**.  

Once again, let me warn everybody there will be a lot of hacking, setbacks, and frustration. What else do you expect from an OS course? It's about plumbing, the dirty jobs that get the million lines of software working. If you expect OS class to be "push button" experiences, one that you can type a few commands and everything works magically w/o breaking, there is no such a thing. 

**Q5: Why am I spending all time on code details, instead of learning OS concepts?**

I hope you attend every lecture, where we teach OS concepts. But if details prevent you from seeing the big picture, you are not spending enough time to master them. 

**Q6: why are some lecture contents unrelated to projects?** 

Lecture contents are a superset of the knowledge needed for the projects. Projects can only cover a small fraction of OS contents that students should know. We don't have enough time.
