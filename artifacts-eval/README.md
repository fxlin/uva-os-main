This artifact evaluation has two parts: 

- Running the OS on QEMU. Required: a Win10/11 machine with 16GB+ memory. See [QEMU Setup](artifact-qemu.md). This is easier. 

- Running the OS on a real device (raspberry pi3, or raspi3). See [Raspberry Pi Setup](artifact-rpi3.md). This requires hardware setup and requires more effort. 


All the needed artifacts have been uploaded; see the submission doc for download links.
